## Overview

The data aggregation module is responsible for transforming fine-grained monitoring data into structured log data that summarizes the server's behavior over a specific time period. It serves as a key component in the log data generation cycle. In addition to the core aggregation functionality, the module also manages the behavior of the  entire log aggregation cycle. The workflow is as follows:

1. Call the collector's API to get the serial data from the server
2. Invoke the anomaly detection module to filter out anomalous data before aggregation
3. Use change-point data aggregation method to get the log dara
4. Save the log data and wait util the next log data generation cycle

To further reduce aggregation overhead, multiple data aggregation operations can be cumulatively executed together.


## Practical Experience

### The Time Interval of One Log Data Generation Cycle

The log aggregation interval is determined by multiple factors. The most critical consideration is the desired monitoring resolutionâ€”that is, how frequently the cluster administrator wants to obtain a summarized log entry.

In addition to user preference, the interval should also account for workload volatility. If significant fluctuations are detected within a single log generation cycle (e.g., more than three notable changes), it may be necessary to increase the aggregation interval. This helps ensure that the log data accurately reflects system trends, rather than transient anomalies.
